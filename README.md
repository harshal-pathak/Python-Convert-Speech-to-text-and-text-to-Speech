# Speech Recognition 
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 library of Python.


# Installation required: 

# Python Speech Recognition module: 

pip install speechrecognition\n

pip install pyaudio\n

# Python pyttsx3 module: 

pip install pyttsx3\n
Speech Input Using a Microphone and Translation of Speech to Text 

Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level. 
Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet connection to work. However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous installation process that requires several dependencies. Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use.
